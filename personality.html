										<h2>This section provides the answers to the assignment questions<br class="mobile-hide" />
										and the test results are further below</h2>
										<p>What do the test results mean to me?</p>
									</header>
										<p>I have done many of these tests over the last few years and I 
										always find it hard to decide how to answer, should I select how I 
										really feel inside versus how I act because I know it is expected of 
										me. For example, even though I am not always the most talkative in a 
										room, I can attend a dinner party full of strangers and drive 
										conversation if I need to make an impression or if everyone is very 
										reserved. I also feel unconfident most of the time but no one would 
										ever describe me as such as I like to drive team outcomes and lead 
										decision making. These results for me ended up just as I expected, 
										they don’t entirely line up with how I think of myself but in some 
										areas the comments were spot on. One item to note is that the results 
										tend to be centred close to the middle rather than being very decisive 
										one way of the other. I believe this reflects my point above but also 
										shows that I can be adaptable in a team, tailoring my behaviour to 
										suit the team dynamic.</p>
										<p>The 16 personalities test was particularly accurate, reflecting 
										that I naturally feel introverted, focus on the past, am 
										self-conscious and sensitive to stress. All of these traits I 
										understand and I make efforts to work around them so they aren’t a 
										detriment to my work or family life.</p>
										<p>My learning style test showed I like to learn by doing which is 
										true but I think the visual learning style could actually be my 
										strongest.</p>
										<p>I found the big Five test least correct. I would have expected to 
										score lower than 50% in Openness and much higher in Neuroticism.</p>
									<header class="style1">
										<p>How do you think these results might influence you in a team</p>
									</header>
										<p>I tend to be flexible in my behaviour in teams to fit in. I do have 
										a tendency to be negative and overly positive personalities tend to 
										grate on me after a time, so I have to be careful not to let that sort 
										of reaction show. I like to take a place in a team where there is a 
										gap to be filled, for example if there is a very strong leader I will 
										follow rather than lead, or if there is someone more technically 
										opinionated than me I will defer to their decision rather than make 
										final technical decisions (as long as the end result will work of 
										course). Because of this I tend not to get fixated on a particular 
										role very often, I work hard and am passionate about the task at hand 
										but am happy to change quickly to perform a different role if it suits 
										the team. I do like autonomy however and find decision by committee 
										rather wasteful, so if my opinion is not being followed I don’t push 
										it, aligning with the next best idea to keep the momentum going.</p>
									<header class="style1">
										<p>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p>
									</header>
										<p>The main results from these tests that I need to take 
										into account when forming a team are ensuring there is a 
										leader I respect and there is a balance between realistic 
										negativity and positive personalities. Apart from that, I need 
										to make sure there is someone with skills (or a willingness to 
										learn) for every type of task, including a team leader. I 
										don’t mind work taking longer if it means one team member is 
										upskilling another resource, it builds depth in the team and I 
										personally like sharing what I have learnt with others. </p>
										<p>Because I can fill various roles, either technical, leadership, 
										requirements capture, scoping or project management, it means that 
										forming a team is sometimes easier as I can be flexible in the 
										part I play. In addition, I can perform one or more roles 
										temporarily to fill a gap due to resource overload or unexpected 
										absences.</p>
