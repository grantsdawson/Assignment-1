										<p>Job Description, skills required and my skills plan</p>
									</header>
									<p>This operational role is particularly interesting to me as it 
									involves many different skills, both commercial and technical. There 
									is a new outsourced delivery model to be implemented along with the 
									responsibility for ongoing vendor management. The yearly operational 
									budget is sizeable and there appears to be involvement in small 
									projects such as improvement programs. Governance forms part of the 
									role, including stakeholder management, technical standards, risk and 
									continuous improvement. Technical experience comes into play directly 
									with involvement in incident and problem resolution, change management 
									and handover to operations from projects. This role would be ideal for 
									me as the mix of responsibilities would always keep me interested. The 
									operational nature of the role would allow me to build an annual 
									routine for consistency, but with the everchanging technical and 
									commercial landscape of telecommunications there will always be new 
									technology to investigate and many opportunities to optimise costs and 
									vendor services.</p>
									<p>The skills, qualifications and experience required for this 
									position include influencing skills, personal relationship building 
									and management abilities, a university degree in IT, ITIL Foundations 
									certification, networking technical certification (i.e. Cisco), 
									experience in large scale vendor management, Oil and gas or Mining 
									field experience, evidence of safety standards and procedure 
									compliance and experience managing technical performance of 
									telecommunications networks.</p>
									<p>I possess most of the skills and experience required for this role, 
									in fact my current role is somewhat similar, just not of the same 
									scale and across different technology. I have managed various hardware 
									and software systems in both insourced and outsourced environments. 
									While my total operational budgets have exceeded $5m annually, 
									individual vendor spend has always been less than $1m. I have been 
									contract owner for one vendor contract but it has been simple and low 
									cost, without strict SLAs to manage performance against. One large 
									item missing for me however is technical skills, qualifications and 
									experience with telecommunication networks. While I have always 
									managed IT systems that rely on networks, I am not technically 
									proficient in their design, configuration or operation.</p>
									<p>My plan to obtain the skills and experience I require for this type 
									of role is quite clear. The biggest task will be completing a degree 
									and becoming technically proficient in telecommunications networks. In 
									parallel to completing my degree, I could apply to move into the 
									networking team to increase my telecommunications experience. In 
									regards to commercial skills, I am not that far off where I would need 
									to be and if I keep gaining work experience in this area while 
									obtaining my technical qualifications. In terms of timing, my 
									qualifications, technical and commercial skills and work experience 
									should all line up nicely in around 5-7 years if I stick to this 
									plan.</p>
