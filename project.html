										<p>Project Overview</p>
									</header>
									<p>When it rains, I forget to pause my home reticulation controller, 
									therefore wasting water. I also have to reprogram my controller after 
									a power outage. To solve this problem, my project is to build a 
									replacement controller based on Arduino. The unit will be connected 
									via WIFI to my home network, with a mobile phone application for 
									control. A status display and quick test buttons will also be included 
									on the physical unit. I will enable integration with weather data 
									sources and a rain sensor for automated pause of watering after rain 
									and add a temperature sensor so I can remotely check on the 
									temperature.</p>
									<header class="style1">
										<p>Motivation</p>
									</header>
									<p>This project will be an important first step for me to build 
									technical skills in a variety of IT systems. It will provide exposure 
									to software programming, software APIs, wired and wireless networks, 
									Arduino controllers and sensors, cloud server services and mobile 
									phone applications. In addition, it will reduce my water usage at 
									home, provide additional data about the basic weather conditions in my 
									local area and save me time currently wasted reprogramming my existing 
									controller after power outages. After successful completion of this 
									project, there may a commercial opportunity in selling the required 
									components and instructions as a DIY kit on Ebay.</p>
									<header class="style1">
										<p>Description</p>
									</header>
									<p>My current reticulation controller is mounted on the wall by my 
									front door, so to maintain a similar aesthetic I will be mounting the 
									finished product in a weather resistant cabinet similar, to this unit 
									from Ericâ€™s Electronics (<a href="http://www.ericselectronics.com/shop/environmental-technology/smar
									t-irrigation-controllers/weather-resistant-irrigation-controller-cabinet
									/">Link to product</a>). The actual Arduino 
									controller, expansion boards, relays, display, test buttons and WIFI 
									adaptor will be mounted in an electronics project enclosure with a 
									clear lid (<a href="https://www.tro-pacific.com/products/enlec-polycarbonate-terminal-box-clear-lid-ip66-300hx230wx100d?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&gclid=CjwKCAjwtuLrBRAlEiwAPVcZBvglyagzkBFG5Tc1do7tROebRMmr2bGNRzTj1Be2QldqeRUGGJGGchoCvmEQAvD_BwE">Link to product</a>) so that the display and inner workings can 
									be seen. The rain and temperature sensor will be located separate to 
									the main controller, in a similar yet smaller enclosure.</p>
									<p>In the controller enclosure, the display will show the current 
									system status, including indication of communications connections, 
									watering currently active or not, what station is active, watering 
									paused due to rain event, temperature, date and time. Some physical 
									buttons will be mounted on the enclosure for quick test of each 
									station, preferable to using the mobile phone application if you have 
									wet and dirty hands from gardening. To monitor access to the 
									controller, a door open sensor will be included.  A plug pack mains 
									power transformer will provide the controller and other components 
									with the 5V-12V DC power required. The temperature and rain sensors 
									(located in a separate enclosure) will be rechargeable battery powered 
									and communicate with the main controller via Bluetooth Low Energy 
									(BLE), while the main controller will communicate with my home network 
									via WiFi.</p>
									<p>Several software features are at the core of this project and will 
									be adjustable via the mobile application. Watering days and duration 
									will be adjustable, allowing for alignment with the seasons, correct 
									watering days for your address and watering bans during certain months 
									of the year. Watering start time will be fixed or variable, tied to 
									sunrise plus or minus a fixed time interval, so your watering could 
									commence 5 minutes before sunrise every day, rather than at 7am every 
									day. Watering will be cancelled if the rain sensor detects rain before 
									or during scheduled watering events and rain sensor data can be 
									correlated with internet weather service data as an addition input to 
									watering cancellation. The pause duration after a rain event will be 
									adjustable. A test function for each zone will be available from the 
									mobile application, in addition to a manual override to the schedule 
									and display of current system status similar in detail to that 
									displayed with the on-board controller display.</p>
									<p>Notifications will be available via the mobile application, 
									including alarm notifications for loss of WiFi or LBE communications, 
									low battery for remote sensor enclosure and activation of the cabinet 
									door open sensor.</p>
									<p>The backend of this project will require various IT systems and 
									features, including connection to a Network Time Protocol (NTP) 
									service for time synchronisation and data integration with a weather 
									service via an API. Depending on the final design, there may be a 
									requirement to build a server in the cloud using AWS to collate and 
									relay data to the mobile application or the Arduino itself.</p>
									<header class="style1">
										<p>Tools and Technologies</p>
									</header>
									<p>A wide variety of tools and technologies are required for this 
									project, including software code version control, desktop PC text 
									editor, Arduino controller board, IO expanders and compatible sensors 
									and relays, Arduino IDE (used to write and upload Arduino code), 
									wireless and wired networking, bluetooth low energy, NTP service, AWS 
									Cloud Servers, IoT mobile application development tool (Blynk or 
									similar), hand and power tools to build enclosure, electronics 
									components, soldering iron, cable, connectors, multi-meter and heat 
									shrink.</p>
									<p>Where possible, physical components will be sourced from local 
									suppliers, both to support local business and to enable me to 
									physically inspect component for fit and finish prior to purchasing.</p>
									<header class="style1">
										<p>Skills Required</p>
									</header>
									<p>Learning the skills required for this project is a completely 
									feasible proposition, as there are many tutorials on line for all the 
									components and code, plus many sample Arduino projects to provide 
									inspiration. Specific skills include programming Arduino controller 
									code plus device drivers, Wifi network configuration, domestic 
									internet router configuration, use of the Blynk mobile application 
									platform, building a server using AWS, wiring electronics components, 
									using power and hand tools and drawing schematics and design diagrams 
									in Microsoft Visio.</p>
									<header class="style1">
										<p>Outcome</p>
									</header>
									<p>Given the amount of learning required, my expected outcome from 
									this project will be a functioning demo including hardware and 
									integration of the mobile application. As a stretch target, I will aim 
									for a fully functioning unit that can replace my current sprinkler 
									controller. The intent of using the project as a technical skills 
									uplift will be realised and in the case of hitting my stretch target, 
									my issues with overwatering will be resolved. Completing this project 
									will provide a solid foundation for learning more complicated 
									technical skills in the future across software development, networking 
									and server infrastructure. </p>
