												<h3 class="icon fa-comment">Personal Infomation</h3>
												<p>I was born in Perth, Western Australia. My great grandparents were all born somewhere 
												in Europe, a mix of English, Scottish, German and Polish nationalities. I have never felt 
												the need or desire to learn another language as I have always lived somewhere in 
												Australia, however I can order my favourite foods using smatterings of Indonesian when 
												on holidays in Bali, where I travel with my family a couple of times a year. After high 
												school I completed an Advanced Diploma in Performing Arts (Audio Engineering) from the WA 
												Academy of Performing Arts and since then I have attained certification in various 
												products, technologies and process frameworks (such as ITIL Foundations and Prince 2 
												project management Foundations and Practitioner) but no further higher education. I have 
												a keen interest in film and music so my only real hobbies are watching films and Netflix 
												or playing guitar. That said, my interest in guitar has expanded over the years to 
												repairing and building guitars and I have recently started building guitar pedals.</p>

												<h3 class="icon solid fa-sync">My interest in IT</h3>
												<p>I have always been interested in science and technology, but my interest in IT centres around knowing how something works and how to set it up, not just using it. My first exposure to IT was in the early 1980’s. I was about 8 and my grandfather (who was an accountant) started learning about computers. He soon wrote his own tax auditing software for regional councils across WA and travelled from town to town at various times of the year preparing council audits using the system he wrote. When I was about 10, he bought us a 286 PC with monochrome screen, floppy disk drive and dot matrix printer. There was no windows GUI so we used DOS commands, but it had a word processor and a couple of games (I am struggling to remember all that as it was 30 years ago!). </p>

												<h3 class="icon fa-image">Why I chose RMIT?</h3>
												<p>My driver for taking this course is to gain a formal Bachelor degree level qualification in IT after learning on the job and through short courses for the last 15 odd years. I chose RMIT because I wanted to study online. Open Universities Australia (OUA) has a good reputation for online learning and RMIT is a well-known and reputable Australian University providing the degree I wanted online through OUA.</p>

												<h3 class="icon solid fa-cog">My IT experience</h3>
												<p>Even though I never studied IT, my first career as an audio engineer comprised of technical roles in the film, television and live music industries, where many of the tools to do my work were IT based. This led to working with IT hardware and software issues regularly and, having found an aptitude as an IT generalist, I ended up looking for IT roles quite quickly as there are many more opportunities in IT than the tiny Australian film industry! My first “IT” role was for an event management company, where I would create small websites, make corporate videos and manage the audio visual and IT setup for conferences. From there I went to a role as an audio visual design consultant at an engineering firm (my first corporate office job) where I learnt to design security systems and network cabling infrastructure for office buildings. That consulting role led to an opportunity working in the IT operations department at a mining company where I have worked in various roles for the last 8 years.</p>

												<h3 class="icon solid fa-check">What do I expect to learn?</h3>
												<p>My hope for this degree is that I increase and broaden my base level of technical abilities and perhaps find a specialisation that I wish to pursue along the way, allowing me to move to different roles inside my current organisation.</p>
